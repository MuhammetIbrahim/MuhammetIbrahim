🚀 Aspiring Python ML/AI Developer with a passion for leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. Currently pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems (MIS), I am eager to transition into the dynamic field of AI-powered backend development.

🛠️ During my tenure at "Online Vitrin," a local e-commerce company, I honed my skills in Python by writing scripts to handle JSON data via APIs from Airtable. Additionally, I embraced leadership opportunities as an operations team leader, where I thrived as a problem-solver, tackling various challenges head-on.

💻 My focus is on mastering Python's ML/AI ecosystem (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas) to build intelligent systems and integrating these models into robust backend architectures. Leveraging tools like Django and PostgreSQL, I aim to design scalable and efficient systems that combine the power of AI with reliable data management.

🌟 On the frontend, I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework to ensure seamless user experiences, with plans to enhance my expertise in React and TypeScript.

📚 With a relentless appetite for learning, I embrace Leonardo da Vinci's philosophy: "I am always doing what I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it." This mindset drives me to continuously expand my knowledge, adapt to emerging technologies, and deliver impactful solutions.

🤝 Leveraging communication skills cultivated through my previous role, I excel in collaborating with diverse teams to achieve common goals.

Let’s connect and collaborate on projects that merge AI/ML with scalable backend systems to redefine innovation!
