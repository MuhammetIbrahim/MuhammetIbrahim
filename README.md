# üöÄ Aspiring Python ML/AI Developer

I am passionate about leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. Currently pursuing a degree in **Management Information Systems (MIS)**, I am eager to transition into the dynamic field of AI-powered backend development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Professional Experience

During my tenure at **"Online Vitrin"**, a local e-commerce company:
- I honed my Python skills by writing scripts to handle JSON data via APIs from Airtable.
- Took on leadership opportunities as an **operations team leader**, thriving as a problem-solver and tackling challenges head-on.

## üíª Technical Skills

- **Backend Development**: Expertise in Python, Django, and PostgreSQL to design scalable, efficient systems.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Proficient in **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Pandas** for building intelligent systems.
- **Frontend Development**: Knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and the **Bootstrap** framework, with plans to expand skills in **React** and **TypeScript**.

## üåü Philosophy & Learning Approach

With a relentless appetite for learning, I embrace Leonardo da Vinci's philosophy:

> "I am always doing what I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it."

This mindset drives me to continuously expand my knowledge, adapt to emerging technologies, and deliver impactful solutions.

## ü§ù Collaboration

Leveraging strong communication skills cultivated through my professional experiences, I excel in collaborating with diverse teams to achieve common goals.
