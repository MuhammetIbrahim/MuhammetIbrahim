🚀 Aspiring Software Developer with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Currently pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems (MIS), I am eager to transition into the dynamic world of software development.

🛠️ During my tenure at "Online Vitrin," a local e-commerce company, I honed my skills in Python by writing scripts to handle JSON data via APIs from Airtable. Additionally, I embraced leadership opportunities as an operations team leader, where I thrived as a problem-solver, tackling various challenges head-on.

💻 Now, I am excited to delve deeper into the .NET ecosystem, particularly ASP.NET, MSSQL, and Angular, with the goal of becoming a proficient full-stack developer. While I currently possess a solid foundation in C# fundamentals and MSSQL queries, I am dedicated to broadening my knowledge through ADO.NET and WinForms.

🌟 On the frontend, I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework, ensuring user experiences across platforms.

📚 With a relentless appetite for learning, I embrace Leonardo da Vinci's philosophy: "I am always doing what I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it." This mindset drives me to continuously expand my skill set and adapt to emerging technologies.

🤝 Leveraging communication skills cultivated through my previous role, I am adept at collaborating with diverse teams to achieve common goals.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of innovation!
