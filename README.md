## 🌟 Featured Project: AUZEF Smart Student Assistant

🤖 **AUZEF Smart Student Assistant**  
A comprehensive, AI-powered assistant designed to serve ~200,000 students at Istanbul University.  
The system interprets natural language queries to provide instant, accurate, 24/7 answers from official university documents and real-time announcements.

**Architecture:**  
Engineered a hybrid AI architecture combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for deep knowledge with a dynamic module for live announcements.  
The system features a multi-layered backend managing user sessions with **Redis** and ensuring data persistence with **PostgreSQL**.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time user authentication via web scraping (AKSIS)
- Automated data ingestion for announcements
- Robust API for a live chat interface

**Tech Stack:**  
Python, FastAPI, Langchain, Gemini, Pinecone, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker
